## Running tests locally in Windows

Tests in this repo use web-component-tester (WCT). Currently WCT has an issue in Windows with tests taking about a minute to start.  A workaround is to set two environment variables for Launchpad (a library used by WCT).  These help bypass browser searching which is what causes the delay.  For example:
LAUNCHPAD_BROWSERS=CHROME
LAUNCHPAD_CHROME-'C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application'
